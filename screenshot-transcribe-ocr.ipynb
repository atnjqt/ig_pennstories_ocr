I've been cruising around for a while, dodging the odd massive, interdimensional vine bristling with thorns, when I run into this huge anglerfish, the biggest I've ever seen. I pull a few stunts, try to shake the thing off â€” nothing too fancy. I'm going full-speed when the fish clips me, knocks me into a vine, and... ...well, like I said, I crash. Blammo! On impact, my ship starts making noises like it's coming apart from the inside, and I think, well, that ain't great. Sure enough, I barely get out of there before the electrical systems start sparking like crazy. It's either move fast or die unpleasantly, so I had to put a little distance between me and my poor, fried ship. I camped out near where I crashed at first. I found this skeleton later â€” great find, woul&ve been stupid not to use it.\""

I'd just finished exploring the core of Giant's Dee and needed a new challenge, and none of us had ever been inside Dark Bramble, so I tkink, hey, let's give that a try. I've been cruising around for a while, dodging the odd massive, interdimensional vine bristling with thorns, when I run into this huge anglerfish, the biggest I've ever seen. I pull a few stunts, try to shake the thing off â€” nothing too fancy. I'm going full-speed when the fish clips me, knocks me into a vine, and... ...well, like I said, I crash. Blammo! On impact, my ship starts making noises like it's coming apart from the inside, and I think, well, that ain't great. Sure enough, I barely get out of there before the electrical systems start sparking like crazy. It's either move fast or die unpleasantly, so I had to put a little distance between me and my poor, fried ship. I camped out near where I crashed at first. I found this skeleton later â€” great find, woul&ve been stupid not to use it.\n",

What's weird is I've actually seen a couple of supernovae today. Usually, I'd be fortunate to see just one. Keep an eye or two on the stars, and maybe you'll spot one yourself! Tell me, what can I do for you? I found something! How do I know if I've spotted a supernova? Supernovae look like extra bri ht stars to the naked eye, but if you zoom in with your signalscope you can tell that t ey're actually enormous explosions. Massive stars go supernova at the very end of their life spans, which is why it's so unusual to see two In a single day. I wonder if some of these stars are older than we realized? What are you doing out here? Right now I'm documenting stars. Hornfels noticed our star charts are out of date, so they asked me to update them. Please don't tell the others I said this, but sometimes I think I'm the only traveler out here interested in doing any science at all. ...Er, maybe don't tell Hornfels, either.

I don't mean to brag, but I'm really quite good with the Little Scout, so I've been taking pictures of everything from right here in my campsite. Have you seen the old shipwreck site on the Ember Twin's southern hemisphere, the one shooting a bright beam of light into the sky? It's not one of our own crashes, surprisingly enough - this one's a Nomai ship. You'll find Nomai ruins across the Twins, but, strangely, not a single settlement! Believe me, if there was one to see, I'd have seen it with my Little Scout. So where did they live? Not on the surface, clearly. The Ember Twin is full of cave systems, though - maybe the answer lies underground? How dangerous is that big column of falling sand? On a scale of one to dead, I'd give it a seven or eight. Awfully pretty, though. Right now sand is flowing from Ash Twin to Ember Twin, but did you know the process eventually reverses? We're not com letely sure why the sand flows back and forth between the Twins, but it seems to e a natural phenomena. Oh, if you'd like to see something interesting, check out the other Twin once a little more of its sand drains off. I promise you won't be disappointed. Watch out for falling sand, okay? I've had to dig myself out once or twice, and that's not half as fun as it sounds.\n",

I hope they were useful? The lanet I mentioned may have been frozen solid, or just partially made of ice, like a muc colder Giant's Deep - it's hard to say. It used to be the fifth planet in our solar system. You'll notice, of course, that there's no such planet now. In its place is Dark Bramble, which - how to put this - grew into the space the fifth planet used to occupy. That is, Dark Bramble quite literally appeared at the center of the fifth planet and be an destroying it from the inside-out. Eventually, the planet shattered completely, an its shards were flung across space. Some of these shards collided with the celestial bodies in our solar system, such as the Attlerock, which I believe is how its biggest crater was formed. I found Nomai writing about a hidden planet. How fascinatin ! It might interest you to know the existence of an additional planet is And honestly, we don't know all that much about what's out there. The farther you go, the less we know!

I've observed the Quantum Moon orbiting each of the five planets, but sometimes, it quite simply disappears from the sky altogether. Maybe there's another place it travels to! Unfortunately, if there is, I've never seen it. Perhaps if I take a closer look at these star charts... I found Nomai writing about the Sun Station. Is that what's in orbit around the sun, then, do you think? This... Sun Station? Quite clever of the Nomai to devise a way to study the sun up close and personal! It must have been tremendously difficult to construct. ...And hot inside. I can only imagine!

They're in the double digits now, and that's, you know, not normal. Not normal at all... Why are so many stars going supernovae? I have no idea! Massive stars go supernova when they reach the end of their life spans, so it's possible that the stars are older than we realized.

So hey, don't freak out or anything, but lately I keep, like, dying repeatedly. I dunno, it's pretty weird. What about you? Have you died lately, or is it just me? No, it's me, too. We're in a time loop. Time has been behaving unusually lately. Yeah, a time loop makes sense. Cool. You're taking this pretty well. Heh, right back at you.

Even if I tell Hornfels about the time loop, they never remember by the next one. They don't realize anything's different. And here's another weird one for you - eve time I die, all of my memories from that loop replay back to me. I'm pretty sure that s related to this big stone Nomai statue I found on one of the other islands. I was lookin at it, and the statue opened its eyes and started glowing. It replayed my memories lik it'd seen them through my own eyes, just like what happens each time I die. That happened to me with the statue at the museum. You too, huh? Then the Nomai statues must have something to do with why we're the only ones aware of the time loop. So... no glowing statue, no time loop awareness?
