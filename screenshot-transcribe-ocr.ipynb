      "Hornfels asked me to update our star charts, so I'm out here observing. This is one of the best places in the solar system to spot astronomical events, you know. What's weird is I've actually seen a couple of supernovae today. Usually, I'd be fortunate to see just one. Keep an eye or two on the stars, and maybe you'll spot one yourself! Tell me, what can I do for you? I found something! How do I know if I've spotted a supernova? Supernovae look like extra bri ht stars to the naked eye, but if you zoom in with your signalscope you can tell that t ey're actually enormous explosions. Massive stars go supernova at the very end of their life spans, which is why it's so unusual to see two In a single day. I wonder if some of these stars are older than we realized? What are you doing out here? Right now I'm documenting stars. Hornfels noticed our star charts are out of date, so they asked me to update them. Please don't tell the others I said this, but sometimes I think I'm the only traveler out here interested in doing any science at all. ...Er, maybe don't tell Hornfels, either. I think they're pretty deep in denial. Where should I explore here?\n",

      "EYE LOCATOR SCROLL PLANET: ATTLEROCK SCENE: AR EYE LOCATOR 2 CHERT Where should I explore here? To be honest, I haven't left this lakebed. I don't mean to brag, but I'm really quite good with the Little Scout, so I've been taking pictures of everything from right here in my campsite. Have you seen the old shipwreck site on the Ember Twin's southern hemisphere, the one shooting a bright beam of light into the sky? It's not one of our own crashes, surprisingly enough - this one's a Nomai ship. You'll find Nomai ruins across the Twins, but, strangely, not a single settlement! Believe me, if there was one to see, I'd have seen it with my Little Scout. So where did they live? Not on the surface, clearly. The Ember Twin is full of cave systems, though - maybe the answer lies underground? How dangerous is that big column of falling sand? On a scale of one to dead, I'd give it a seven or eight. Awfully pretty, though. Right now sand is flowing from Ash Twin to Ember Twin, but did you know the process eventually reverses? We're not com letely sure why the sand flows back and forth between the Twins, but it seems to e a natural phenomena. Oh, if you'd like to see something interesting, check out the other Twin once a little more of its sand drains off. I promise you won't be disappointed. Watch out for falling sand, okay? I've had to dig myself out once or twice, and that's not half as fun as it sounds.\n",

      "RIEBECK - ATTLEROCK NOTES PLANET: ATTLEROCK SCENE: AR EYE LOCATOR 3 CHERT I found something! Please, do tell! I found your notes about the Attlerock's main crater. Did you! I hope they were useful? The lanet I mentioned may have been frozen solid, or just partially made of ice, like a muc colder Giant's Deep - it's hard to say. It used to be the fifth planet in our solar system. You'll notice, of course, that there's no such planet now. In its place is Dark Bramble, which - how to put this - grew into the space the fifth planet used to occupy. That is, Dark Bramble quite literally appeared at the center of the fifth planet and be an destroying it from the inside-out. Eventually, the planet shattered completely, an its shards were flung across space. Some of these shards collided with the celestial bodies in our solar system, such as the Attlerock, which I believe is how its biggest crater was formed. I found Nomai writing about a hidden planet. How fascinatin ! It might interest you to know the existence of an additional planet is And honestly, we don't know all that much about what's out there. The farther you go, the less we know! As such, it's well within the realm of possibility such a planet exists.\n",

Who wouldn't wonder about a moon that's sometimes there and sometimes not. I've observed the Quantum Moon orbiting each of the five planets, but sometimes, it quite simply disappears from the sky altogether. Maybe there's another place it travels to! Unfortunately, if there is, I've never seen it. Perhaps if I take a closer look at these star charts... I found Nomai writing about the Sun Station. Is that what's in orbit around the sun, then, do you think? This... Sun Station? Quite clever of the Nomai to devise a way to study the sun up close and personal! It must have been tremendously difficult to construct. ...And hot inside. I can only imagine! I wonder how were they able to travel back and forth from the Sun Station and the Hourglass Twins, when the slightest slip up would have meant a fiery death. rtow dangerous IS that big column ot talllng sand' Just saying hi.

They're in the double digits now, and that's, you know, not normal. Not normal at all... Why are so many stars going supernovae? I have no idea! Massive stars go supernova when they reach the end of their life spans, so it's possible that the stars are older than we realized. Or maybe our models are wrong and they don't live as long as we expected. Honestly, I'm not fond of either option! If our charts are wrong, what else is wrong? And our sun... No, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. l- I'm probably overlooking something. That's it, I just need to collect more data. Just saying hi. Watch out for the stars. I mean, sand.\n",

So hey, don't freak out or anything, but lately I keep, like, dying repeatedly. I dunno, it's pretty weird. What about you? Have you died lately, or is it just me? No, it's me, too. We're in a time loop. Time has been behaving unusually lately. Yeah, a time loop makes sense. Cool. You're taking this pretty well. Heh, right back at you. Personally, I like new experiences, and I've never been in a time loop before. I mean, I don't think I've been in a time loop before this one. It looks like you and I are the only ones who can tell that time's one all weird. I tried radioing Hornfels and asking if they'd died, too, but they though I was being metaphorical. Even if I tell Hornfels about the time loop, they never remember by the next one. They don't realize anything's different. And here's another weird one for you - eve time I die, all of my memories from that loop replay back to me. I'm pretty sure that s related to this big stone Nomai statue I found on one of the other islands. I was lookin at it, and the statue opened its eyes and started glowing. It replayed my memories lik it'd seen them through my own eyes, just like what happens each time I die. That happened to me with the statue at the museum. You too, huh? Then the Nomai statues must have something to do with why we're the only ones aware of the time loop. So... no glowing statue, no time loop awareness? I think that's going to be my leading theory, but if you find out anything new about the statues or the time loop, let me know, okay? I'll be here. What did you think it was? I figured it'd be some kind of fid ety time business, but I wasn't really thinking about what's happening to the shape o time, you know? But a loop makes sense here.

Beautifully carved, too. So one minute I'm standing on an island looking at a Nomai sculpture on the beach, and the next thing I know, It's looking back at me, glowing. The sculpture replays everything I've just done, like it's been watching me through my own eyes, you know? And then suddenly it stops and everything's normal again. That ha pened to me at the observatory. It didn't seem bad, just... weird? Were we the only ones who saw that happen? I tried radioing Hornfels and asking them about it, but they told me I must have just nodded off out here and gotten confused.

Well, if you remember dying, then I guess I didn't just fall asleep and have a weird dream or something. But stars above, what's going on, then? And then there was that thing with the Nomai statue earlier... Come to think of it, when I died, I saw what I'm pretty sure were my memories going backward, just like the time with that statue.
